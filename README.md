# SpongebobGame
This game is an intense basketball game where Spongebob and Patrick are trying to score as many baskets as possible.
They are both limited to their half and can't enter their opponent's side of the court.
When the ball interacts with one of the characters, the ball travels in the other direction.
When one of the characters score, the ball is brought back to the middle of the court and some confetti shows up celebrating the basket.
